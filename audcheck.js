This module consists of two parts - a basic volume adjustment
and a loudness judgment task. It should take fewer than 5
minutes to complete in total.

Make sure that the volume adjustment stimulus ('volumetest.mp3')
is normalized according to the stimuli you want to present!

The loudness judgment task comes from the McDermott lab (2017)
and should be relatively easy if wearing headphones (but quite
difficult if listening over typical computer speakers.

In the main index.html script, you should reference two things:

1. You must push 'audcheck' to the timeline [i.e., timeline.push(audcheck);] 
when you want the task to run

2. Use the 'return_audcheck_folder' function to name your own folder 
for the audio files (for preloading). This is optional -- if you do not
do this, you should specify that 'audcheck_files' is the variable to be
preloaded for audio
